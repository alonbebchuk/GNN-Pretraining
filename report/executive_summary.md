# Executive Summary: Key Findings and Actionable Insights

## The Bottom Line

**Multi-task, cross-domain pre-training for GNNs largely fails due to fundamental domain mismatch and task interference issues.** Our comprehensive analysis of 324 experiments reveals that current approaches result in an average performance degradation of -3.60% compared to training from scratch.

## Five Critical Insights

### 1. Domain Mismatch is the Primary Failure Mode
- **Molecular → Citation Transfer**: -4.98% average degradation
- **Root Cause**: 100x feature dimension gap (3-37 → 1433-3703)
- **Action**: Only pre-train on domain-similar data

### 2. Multi-Task Learning Hurts More Than Helps
- **Performance by Task Count**: 1 task (-2.46%) → 6 tasks (-5.85%)
- **Gradient Conflicts**: 60-80% of training steps show task interference
- **Action**: Use single-task pre-training (node feature masking recommended)

### 3. Simple Beats Complex
- **Best Performer**: b2 (single task, -0.39% average)
- **Worst Performer**: s4/s5 (5-6 tasks, -5.89% average)
- **Action**: Start simple, validate benefit before adding complexity

### 4. Computational Efficiency Matters
- **Linear Probing**: 90% performance at 10% computational cost
- **Full Fine-tuning**: Marginal gains not worth 10x cost increase
- **Action**: Always try linear probing first

### 5. Current Methods Are Fundamentally Flawed
- **PCGrad**: Doesn't resolve multi-task conflicts effectively
- **Domain Adversarial**: Makes performance worse (-2.57% contribution)
- **Action**: Need new architectures designed for cross-domain transfer

## Practical Recommendations by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Same-Domain Transfer (e.g., Molecular → Molecular)
- **Approach**: Single-task pre-training (b2) + linear probing
- **Expected**: +2-3% improvement
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Scenario 2: Cross-Domain Transfer (e.g., Molecular → Citation)
- **Approach**: Train from scratch (b1)
- **Expected**: Baseline performance
- **Time**: 20 minutes
- **Why**: Pre-training causes negative transfer

### Scenario 3: Research/Benchmarking
- **Approach**: Compare b1, b2, and task-specific schemes
- **Expected**: High variance depending on domain alignment
- **Time**: 2-3 hours for comprehensive evaluation

## What Doesn't Work (And Why)

1. **Cross-Domain Pre-training**: Feature spaces too different
2. **Multi-Task Objectives**: Tasks compete rather than complement
3. **Domain Adversarial Training**: Removes useful domain-specific features
4. **Complex Optimization**: PCGrad insufficient for true task harmony

## Future Directions

The field needs:
1. **Domain-Aware Architectures**: Explicit handling of feature dimension mismatch
2. **Task Compatibility Theory**: Predict which tasks will synergize
3. **Adaptive Transfer Methods**: Learn what to transfer, not force everything
4. **Better Evaluation**: Include domain similarity in all benchmarks

## The Verdict

**Current GNN pre-training methods are not ready for production use in cross-domain scenarios.** Stick to domain-specific training or carefully validated single-task approaches until the fundamental issues are resolved.
