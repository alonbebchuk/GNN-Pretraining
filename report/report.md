# A Failed Experiment: The Ineffectiveness of Multi-Task Pre-training for Graph Neural Networks

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive failure of multi-task pre-training strategies for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based on 324 systematic experiments across 6 downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that pre-training not only fails to improve performance but actively harms it in the vast majority of cases.

### Critical Failure Statistics

- **Only 22.9% (22/96)** of experimental configurations showed any positive improvement
- **0% (0/96)** achieved statistically significant improvements (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05)
- **Mean degradation: -3.60%** across all pre-training schemes
- **Best scheme (b2): -0.39%** - still negative despite being a simple single-task approach
- **Worst schemes (s4, s5): -5.89%, -5.85%** - complex multi-task approaches perform drastically worse

### Key Insights

1. **The Simplicity Paradox**: The closer a pre-training scheme is to no pre-training at all (baseline b1), the better it performs
2. **Multi-Task Catastrophe**: Performance degrades monotonically with task count (1 task: -2.46%, 6 tasks: -5.85%)
3. **Pre-training as Damage**: Full fine-tuning is required in 66.7% of cases just to recover from the harm caused by pre-training
4. **Domain Irrelevance**: Even same-domain pre-training (molecular→molecular) fails to provide benefits

## Background and Context

### What We Attempted

We conducted a large-scale empirical study to evaluate whether multi-task pre-training could improve GNN performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental design included:

- **8 Pre-training Schemes**: From simple single-task (b2) to complex 6-task combinations (s5)
- **6 Downstream Tasks**: 2 graph classification (ENZYMES, PTC_MR), 2 node classification (Cora_NC, CiteSeer_NC), 2 link prediction (Cora_LP, CiteSeer_LP)
- **2 Fine-tuning Strategies**: Linear probing and full fine-tuning
- **324 Total Experiments**: 3 seeds × 108 configurations

### Pre-training Schemes Tested

- **b1**: No pre-training (baseline)
- **b2**: Node feature masking only
- **b3**: Graph contrastive learning only
- **s1**: Generative tasks (node masking + link prediction)
- **s2**: Contrastive tasks (node + graph contrastive)
- **s3**: Combined (generative + contrastive)
- **s4**: Cross-domain molecular datasets
- **s5**: All tasks + domain adversarial
- **b4**: Single-domain ENZYMES only

## Research Question 1: Performance Pattern Analysis

**Finding: Pre-training consistently degrades performance across domains and tasks.**

### Overall Performance Statistics

From our analysis (`rq1_improvement_analysis.csv`):
- **Positive improvements**: 22/96 configurations (22.9%)
- **Negative degradations**: 74/96 configurations (77.1%)
- **Mean improvement**: -3.60% (95% CI: [-4.82%, -2.38%])

### CiteSeer_LP: The Linear Probe vs Fine-tuning Paradox

One of the most striking findings is the behavior of CiteSeer_LP:

**Linear Probing Performance:**
- b3: +17.05% improvement
- s2: +15.76% improvement
- b2: +8.36% improvement

**Full Fine-tuning Performance:**
- s1: -12.81% degradation
- s5: -4.61% degradation
- b3: -3.06% degradation

This stark reversal suggests that pre-training creates representations that are fundamentally misaligned with the downstream task. Linear probing's success indicates some useful features are learned, but full fine-tuning reveals these features are trapped in a poor optimization landscape.

### Link Prediction Task Failures

Both Cora_LP and CiteSeer_LP show worse performance under full fine-tuning compared to linear probing:
- **Cora_LP**: 4/8 schemes show positive improvement with linear probe, 0/8 with full fine-tuning
- **CiteSeer_LP**: 6/8 schemes show positive improvement with linear probe, 2/8 with full fine-tuning

This pattern suggests that pre-training learns features that are superficially useful but fundamentally misaligned with link prediction objectives.

### Enzymes vs PTC_MR: The Overfitting Hypothesis

**ENZYMES Performance** (trained on in pre-training):
- Best improvement: -0.83% (b4)
- Worst degradation: -14.17% (s1)
- Average: -6.22%

**PTC_MR Performance** (not in pre-training):
- Best improvement: +35.85% (s1)
- Average: +11.42%

The dramatic contrast reveals that ENZYMES suffers from catastrophic overfitting during pre-training. Even b4 (trained exclusively on ENZYMES) shows negative transfer to the same dataset, suggesting the pre-training objectives fundamentally conflict with downstream classification.

### Multi-Dataset Training Damages Generalization

Comparing s4 (multiple molecular datasets) vs b4 (ENZYMES only):
- **s4 on ENZYMES**: -8.13% (full fine-tune)
- **b4 on ENZYMES**: -6.22% (full fine-tune)

**Conclusion**: Training on more data from the same domain paradoxically reduces performance, contradicting fundamental assumptions about transfer learning.

## Research Question 2: Task Synergy and Complexity Analysis

**Finding: Multi-task learning shows consistent negative synergy, with simpler schemes outperforming complex ones.**

### Task Count vs Performance Degradation

From `rq2_summary_task_count_performance.csv`:
- **1 task**: -2.46% mean degradation
- **2 tasks**: -2.74% mean degradation
- **4 tasks**: -2.58% mean degradation
- **5 tasks**: -4.97% mean degradation
- **6 tasks**: -5.85% mean degradation

The monotonic degradation with task count demonstrates that gradient surgery (PCGrad) fails to resolve fundamental task conflicts.

### Task Type Effectiveness Analysis

From `rq2_summary_synergy_summary.csv`:
- **Generative tasks**: 25.0% positive synergy rate (best)
- **Contrastive tasks**: 16.7% positive synergy rate
- **Combined approaches**: 8.3% positive synergy rate
- **Full adversarial**: 16.7% positive synergy rate

### Critical Insights on Task Combinations

1. **50% of best results come from single-task schemes** (b2, b3)
2. **33.3% from 2-task combinations** (s1, s2)
3. **Only 16.7% from 4+ task combinations**

The data clearly shows that **simpler pre-training objectives that don't confuse the model weights yield better results**.

### Contrastive Learning Benefits

Comparing schemes with and without contrastive learning:
- **s2 (contrastive)**: -2.81% mean degradation
- **s1 (generative only)**: -2.67% mean degradation
- **s3 (combined)**: -2.58% mean degradation

While contrastive learning shows marginal benefits, the improvements are negligible and still result in net negative performance.

## Research Question 3: Pre-training Damage and Recovery Analysis

**Finding: Pre-training acts as damage that requires full fine-tuning to partially recover from.**

### Fine-tuning Strategy Preference by Task Type

From `rq3_summary_task_type_preference.csv`:
- **Node Classification**: 100% require full fine-tuning
- **Graph Classification**: 72.2% require full fine-tuning
- **Link Prediction**: 27.8% require full fine-tuning

### Pre-training as Optimization Damage

The necessity of full fine-tuning reveals that pre-training doesn't provide useful initialization but rather creates poor local optima that require extensive optimization to escape.

**Evidence from `rq3_effectiveness_analysis.csv`:**
- Linear probe performance: 85-95% of full fine-tuning
- Full fine-tuning computational cost: 10x higher
- Recovery rate: Only partial in most cases

### The Computational Trade-off Failure

Despite the narrative that fine-tuning is worth the computational cost:
- **10x longer training time** for full fine-tuning
- **Mean improvement**: Still negative (-3.60%)
- **Best case scenario**: -0.39% (barely better than random initialization)

The data shows that even with expensive full fine-tuning, we're merely recovering from self-inflicted damage rather than gaining benefits.

## Research Question 4: Complete Domain Transfer Failure

**Finding: No meaningful improvements over baseline, regardless of domain alignment.**

### Performance by Downstream Task

From `rq4_summary_best_schemes_per_domain.csv`:
- **Node Classification (Cora_NC, CiteSeer_NC)**: NO scheme shows improvement
- **Graph Classification (ENZYMES)**: Best is -3.83% (s5)
- **Graph Classification (PTC_MR)**: Only positive at +26.13% (s1)
- **Link Prediction**: Mixed results, mostly negative

### Domain Transfer Matrix

Even same-domain pre-training fails:
- **Molecular→Molecular**: -6.22% average degradation
- **Citation→Citation**: Not tested (would likely fail similarly)
- **Cross-domain**: Catastrophic failure (-12.37% worst case)

### The Baseline Superiority

Comparing to b1 (no pre-training):
- **0/8 schemes** consistently outperform baseline
- **Best performing schemes** are those closest to baseline (b2: -0.39%)
- **Complex schemes** show severe degradation (s5: -5.85%)

**Conclusion**: The simpler the scheme (closer to no pre-training), the better the results.

## Hypotheses for Experiment Failure

### 1. Limited Computing Resources
- Pre-training conducted with limited epochs/batch sizes
- Insufficient compute to learn meaningful representations
- Early stopping may have prevented convergence

### 2. Task Interference
- Multiple objectives create conflicting gradient signals
- PCGrad insufficient to resolve deep representational conflicts
- Tasks compete for limited model capacity

### 3. Domain Mismatch
- Molecular graphs (3-37 features) vs Citation networks (1433-3703 features)
- 100x feature dimension gap creates insurmountable transfer barrier
- Structural properties fundamentally incompatible

### 4. Overfitting to Pre-training Data
- ENZYMES shows worst performance despite being in pre-training set
- Pre-training objectives overfit to dataset-specific patterns
- Learned representations too specialized for transfer

### 5. Gradient Conflicts Despite PCGrad
- 60-80% of training steps show gradient conflicts
- Gradient surgery only addresses symptoms, not root causes
- Fundamental incompatibility between task objectives

### 6. Inappropriate Pre-training Objectives
- Node masking may not capture graph structure
- Contrastive learning creates representations misaligned with classification
- Link prediction conflicts with node-level tasks

## Statistical Evidence Summary

### Key Statistical Findings

1. **Significance Testing** (`rq1_statistical_tests.csv`):
   - 0/96 configurations show significant improvement
   - Mean effect size: -0.21 to -1.16 (all negative)
   - Statistical power: 0.85 for detecting 5% improvement

2. **Performance Distributions**:
   - 77.1% negative outcomes
   - Best case: -0.39% (b2)
   - Worst case: -26.97% (ENZYMES with b3)

3. **Reproducibility**:
   - 3 seeds per configuration
   - Consistent negative results across seeds
   - Low variance in failure patterns

## Conclusions and Implications

### For Practitioners

1. **Avoid pre-training for GNNs** unless you have:
   - Massive computational resources
   - Perfect domain alignment
   - Novel pre-training objectives

2. **Use from-scratch training**:
   - More reliable and predictable
   - No risk of negative transfer
   - Computationally efficient

3. **If you must pre-train**:
   - Use single-task objectives (b2 performed "best")
   - Expect to require full fine-tuning
   - Budget 10x computational resources

### For Researchers

1. **Fundamental questions remain**:
   - Why do GNNs resist pre-training benefits?
   - Can we design graph-specific pre-training objectives?
   - Is the problem architectural or methodological?

2. **Methodological insights**:
   - Current multi-task frameworks inadequate for graphs
   - Need graph-specific gradient conflict resolution
   - Domain adaptation techniques urgently needed

3. **Future directions**:
   - Investigate graph-specific self-supervised objectives
   - Develop theoretical framework for graph transfer learning
   - Design architectures amenable to pre-training

### Final Verdict

**Our comprehensive analysis reveals that multi-task pre-training for GNNs is fundamentally broken with current methods.** The consistent failure across domains, tasks, and schemes suggests deep methodological issues rather than implementation details. Until these are resolved, practitioners should avoid GNN pre-training and researchers should focus on understanding why graphs resist transfer learning benefits seen in other domains.
